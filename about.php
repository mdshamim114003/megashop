                <p>One of my favourite things I like to watch is the bloopers and outtakes that are shown of mistakes
                    made during the making of a movie. Most DVD’s have a section of outtakes to be viewed, and often
                    they will set me off laughing, especially when you know what was supposed to happen. In one sense
                    it seems strange to laugh at other people’s mistakes, and yet we all do it, and our enjoyment is
                    not usually of malicious intent. We laugh because we can all relate and identify how much part of
                    being human such bloopers are! We all make mistakes, and have many bloopers and outtakes in a
                    lifetime.</p>
                <p>Some of them may be funny like movie bloopers, a stupid mistake and we are able to laugh at our
                    selves. Other outtakes in life, however, are not funny, and are neither unforeseen nor self
                    imposed. I am referring to the tragic turns of events that happen in life that can turn our life.</p>
